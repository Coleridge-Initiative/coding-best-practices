# Writing Robust Code and Organizing Code Checklist

This checklist provides examples of best practices for writing clean, modular code, ensuring reliability with testing, creating clear and efficient documentation, optimizing for performance constraints, and organizing analytical projects for clarity and reproducibility.

Each section offers tips and best practices for reproducible code in analytical projects.

---

## **Modularity**
Breaking a program into small, independent functions (modules), where each function performs a specific task. Modular code is reusable, testable, maintainable, and easy to document.

### **Best Practices**
- Divide code by logical steps, key measures, or analytical decisions.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; implement only required features.
- Eliminate duplicated code.
- Abstract key steps into short, readable functions.
- Ensure functions are reusable and parameterized for flexibility.

### **Tools**
- **R**: 
  - `function()`: Create reusable functions.
  - `devtools`: Modularize code into R packages for reuse.
  - `source()`: Load modular scripts into your environment.
  - Code snippets in RStudio for custom templates in R, SQL, or Python.
- **Python**:
  - `def()`: Define reusable functions.
  - Modules and packages: Break code into `.py` files and import as needed.

## **Testing**
Ensuring code behaves as expected, especially with changing data or codebases. Testing helps catch bugs early and maintain functionality.

### **Best Practices**
- Write tests for each function or module.
- Include edge cases (e.g., empty data, invalid inputs).
- Create new tests for identified bugs.
- Use tests to validate output correctness and detect format issues.
- Ensure new changes don’t break existing functionality.

### **Tools**
- **R**: `testthat` for unit testing.
- **Python**: `unittest` or `pytest` for testing modular functions.

---

## **Documentation**
Clear, concise, and updated documentation ensures code is understandable and maintainable.

### **Best Practices**
- Write self-explanatory code to minimize repetitive documentation.
- Keep documentation close to the code.
- Update documentation with code changes.
- Convert documentation into shareable formats (e.g., PDF, HTML).

### **Tools**
- **R**: `roxygen` for inline documentation that generates package docs.
- **Python**: `Sphinx` for creating documentation from code and docstrings.

---

## **Working with Performance Constraints**
Optimizing code for large datasets ensures efficient processing and avoids memory issues.

### **Best Practices**
- Test new code on small datasets.
- Remove unnecessary large objects from memory.
- Load only required data columns.
- Verify data observation units before joins to avoid duplicates.
- Process large datasets in chunks.

### **SQL Advantage**
- Perform heavy computations directly in databases using SQL for faster execution.

---

## **Project Structure**
A clear project structure ensures workflow clarity and reproducibility in analytical projects.

### **Best Practices**
- Separate functionality into individual scripts for modularity.
- Divide finalized code and exploratory code into separate folders.
- Create a `tests/` folder for validating core functions.
- Use a `docs/` folder for project documentation.
- Maintain logical organization for easy understanding and collaboration.

### **Directory Layout: Example**
<pre> ```bash 
project-name/ 
  │ ├── data/ # Data directory (raw and processed data) ├── src_code/ # Core source code ├── code_explore/ # Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown for exploration, reporting ├── tests/ # Test scripts ├── docs/ # Documentation (user guide, reference, etc.) ├── outputs/ # Generated reports, visualizations, dashboards └── README.md # Project overview (goals, configuration requirements) ``` </pre>

### **README.md Contents**
- Description of project goals.
- Setup instructions (dependencies, execution steps).
- Summary of results.

By following this checklist, you can create robust, reproducible, and well-organized analytical projects.
