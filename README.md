- [ ] Define roles and responsibilities for each collaborator.
- [ ] Set up a communication system (e.g., ADRF chat, email, or video calls) for project discussions.
- [ ] Schedule regular check-ins to review project progress and milestones.

#### 6. **Security and Compliance**
- [ ] Review all relevant data security and compliance guidelines (e.g., FERPA, HIPAA, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure you are handling sensitive data appropriately within ADRF’s secure environment.
